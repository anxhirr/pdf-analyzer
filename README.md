## Testing

### API Testing

Run the enhanced test script to verify all functionality:

```bash
python test_enhanced_api.py
```

This will test:

- URL processing with PDF download and content extraction
- Link extraction from uploaded files
- Content analysis and metadata extraction

### Example Usage

1. **Process URL directly**: Use the "Process URLs" tab to download and analyze PDFs from URLs like:

   ```
   http://www.qkb.gov.al/umbraco/Surface/SearchSurface/GenerateBulletinExtract?subjectDefCode=3AC4FF72-172E-4173-BC32-1D3E24F2AE41&isSimple=true
   ```

2. **Extract and Process**: Upload a PDF containing links, and the system will automatically find PDF URLs and download/analyze them.

3. **Manual Processing**: Use the API endpoints directly for programmatic access.

## Link Types Detected

1. **Text URLs**: HTTP/HTTPS URLs found in the PDF text content
2. **Email Addresses**: Email addresses found in the text (converted to mailto: links)
3. **PDF Annotations**: Clickable links embedded as PDF annotations
4. **Hyperlinks**: Links embedded in the PDF structure (when available)

## Dependencies

- **FastAPI**: Modern web framework for building APIs
- **PyPDF2**: PDF processing library for annotations and basic text extraction
- **pdfplumber**: Advanced PDF processing for better text extraction
- **uvicorn**: ASGI server for running the FastAPI application
- **aiofiles**: Async file operations
- **python-multipart**: For handling file uploads

## Error Handling

The application includes comprehensive error handling for:

- Invalid file types (non-PDF files)
- Corrupted PDF files
- Empty files
- Network connectivity issues
- Server errors

## Performance Considerations

- The application processes PDFs in memory for better performance
- Large PDF files may require more processing time
- Duplicate links are efficiently removed using set operations
- Both PDF libraries are used to ensure maximum link detection
